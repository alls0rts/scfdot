scfdot - Generate a graphviz file of SMF services and dependencies

The Service Management Facility (SMF) is responsible for managing services
and service start order in the Oracle Solaris operating system. Run
"man smf" for more information. scfdot reads the service names and
dependencies from the Service Configuration Facility (SCF) repository
and writes a file which the dot program from the graphviz package can
render into a graph.

Once graphviz is installed and dot and cc are on your path, you should be able
to generate a PostScript file of the dependency graph on your system by
running

	$ make

This will compile scfdot.c, execute it, and execute dot to produce
$HOSTNAME.ps.  If dot is not on your path, then modify Makefile to indicate
how to invoke dot.  If cc is not available, add a line to Makefile which sets
CC to how to invoke your compiler.

To view the graph with gv, I recommend

  - The -noantialias option.  Otherwise the black labels on the colored
    backgrounds look bad.

  - Adding a 1/100 zoom option to gv and using that for the initial view.
    Otherwise gv will ask your X server for a ton of memory, which can cause
    it to thrash.  Add the option by putting

GV.scales:              Natural size,   1.000,  screen  \n\
                        Pixel based,    1.000,  pixel   \n\
			0.010,		0.010		\n\
                        0.100,          0.100           \n\
                        0.125,          0.125           \n\
                        0.250,          0.250           \n\
                        0.500,          0.500           \n\
                        0.707,          0.707           \n\
                        1.000,          1.000           \n\
                        1.414,          1.414           \n\
                        2.000,          2.000           \n\
                        4.000,          4.000           \n\
                        8.000,          8.000           \n\
                        10.00,          10.00

    in ~/.gv .  Make it the initial view by including "-scale -6" in the
    command line.

The Makefile also has options for changing the command line arguments to
scfdot.  See the comment at the top of scfdot.c for available options.

The files in this package are

	README - This file.

	AUTHORS - Author credits.

	CDDL.LICENSE - License.

	Makefile - Makefile for building scfdot, running it, running the
		   scripts, and running dot to produce a PostScript file of
		   the dependency graph.

	scfdot.c - C program which generates dot files.

	enlarge.awk - awk script which enlarges PostScript files.  Used to
